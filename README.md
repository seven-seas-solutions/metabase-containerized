# Metabase Containerization with PostgreSQL

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to containerize Metabase with PostgreSQL using Docker and Docker Compose. The solution is designed for small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that require easy deployment, scalability, and a powerful business analytics tool without the overhead of complex setup. The containerized environment allows you to run Metabase as a lightweight, secure, and easily maintainable analytics platform for your organization.

## Business Benefits
- **Quick Setup**: Get a full-fledged analytics platform running with just a few commands.
- **Cost-Efficiency**: Reduce operational costs by running analytics without expensive hardware or complex setup.
- **Scalability**: Add more resources as your business grows without needing to overhaul the system.
- **Data Security**: By isolating your analytics platform in containers, ensure that your data remains secure.

## Technologies Used
- **Docker**: For containerizing both the Metabase application and the PostgreSQL database.
- **Docker Compose**: To manage the multi-container environment, making it easy to start, stop, and manage all services.
- **PostgreSQL**: A robust, open-source relational database used by Metabase for data storage.
- **Metabase**: An open-source business intelligence (BI) tool that lets you run powerful data queries and visualize them easily.
