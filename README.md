# Metabase Containerization with PostgreSQL

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to containerize Metabase with PostgreSQL using Docker and Docker Compose. The solution is designed for small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that require easy deployment, scalability, and a powerful business analytics tool without the overhead of complex setup. The containerized environment allows you to run Metabase as a lightweight, secure, and easily maintainable analytics platform for your organization.

## Business Benefits
- **Quick Setup**: Get a full-fledged analytics platform running with just a few commands.
- **Cost-Efficiency**: Reduce operational costs by running analytics without expensive hardware or complex setup.
- **Scalability**: Add more resources as your business grows without needing to overhaul the system.
- **Data Security**: By isolating your analytics platform in containers, ensure that your data remains secure.

## Technologies Used
- **Docker**: For containerizing both the Metabase application and the PostgreSQL database.
- **Docker Compose**: To manage the multi-container environment, making it easy to start, stop, and manage all services.
- **PostgreSQL**: A robust, open-source relational database used by Metabase for data storage.
- **Metabase**: An open-source business intelligence (BI) tool that lets you run powerful data queries and visualize them easily.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your system.
- Docker Compose installed.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/seven-seas-solutions/metabase-containerized.git
   cd metabase-containerized

Run Docker Compose:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up -d
Access Metabase: Once the containers are up and running, access Metabase through your browser at:

bash
Copy code
http://localhost:3000
Initial Setup: Follow the setup wizard in Metabase to configure your initial admin account and connect to the PostgreSQL database.

Example Usage
After setup, you can connect Metabase to your existing PostgreSQL database or other supported data sources to visualize insights and create reports. For example:

View sales data trends over time.
Create a dashboard to monitor customer interactions or revenue growth.
